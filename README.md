* Tile global animations (water, etc.) and specific animations (door, etc.)
* Map object entities (for players, etc.)
* Many usefull functions at your disposal to help you improving your gameplay (tile-picking, etc.)

### F.A.Q
* **Why should I use FisoEngine?**
The advantage of FisoEngine over others isometric engines, is that it is not an ISOMETRIC GAME ENGINE but only an ISOMETRIC ENGINE focused on offering isometric events on a way that you can create YOUR game with YOUR gameplay and add YOUR functionalities without being limited to the engine itself. So if you have a game idea that meets these requirements: "Isometric", "Tile-based", "Using a reasonnable world size", don't hesitate to use the engine.

* **For which graphic engine FisoEngine is made for?**
FisoEngine is not designed for a specific graphic engine. It is designed to use as less graphic engine dependency as possible, to allow anyone to bind the engine sources with its graphic engine without having to modify many lines of code.<br/>
Note: during the development, FisoEngine is only bind with SFML. 

* **What means exactly the term "tile-based"?**
Tile-based means that the world of your game is composed of tiles: a tile is an image that corresponds to a world block, or a floor. Many games are using this kind of world: almost all 2D RPG, turn-based strategy games, etc.

### On which engine part are you working currently?

I am working on the addition of tile animations to the engine. Be ready for the 1.0 release within a month!
