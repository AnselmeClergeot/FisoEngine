### Welcome to the Fiso Engine repository!

Fiso Engine is C++ a **soft**, **simple** and **tile-based** isometric engine made for being **easily bindable with any graphics library**.<br/>
During the development, the engine is bind only with <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php">SFML</a>. <br/>
It is still in development and the beta version has been released.<br/>
Fiso Engine is under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL v3.0 License</a>.<br/>
For more informations, you can contact me by mail at anselmedu25@hotmail.com.

Fiso Engine is very simple of use and will offer all the features you would expect to create your game:
* Map creation/saving and manipulation
* Level editing with map-editor software
* Map dynamic reloading
* Tile color manipulating (color + opacity)
* Map shading
* Tile global animations (water, etc.)
* Tile single animations (door, etc.)
* Map object entities (for players, etc.)
* Simple camera system
* Useful functions at your disposal to help you improving your gameplay (tile-picking, etc.)

### Last FisoEngine news ! 
A simple system of spritesheet animations is now available with FisoEngine ! Two new classes are used: Animation and FrameSet.

The tile drawing system order has a little bit changed : removed bug of entities that were hidden by tiles on their top, even if these tiles were behind them.

I am upgrading FisoEngine performances by making the functions that returns heavy-memory classes able to return const references.

### F.A.Q
* **Why should I use FisoEngine?**
The advantage of FisoEngine over others isometric engines, is that it is not an ISOMETRIC GAME ENGINE but only an ISOMETRIC ENGINE focused on offering isometric events on a way that you can create YOUR game with YOUR gameplay and add YOUR functionalities without being limited to the engine itself. So if you have a game idea that meets these requirements: "isometric", "tile-based", don't hesitate to use the engine.

* **For which graphic engine FisoEngine is made for?**
FisoEngine is not designed for a specific graphic engine. It is designed to use as less graphic engine dependency as possible, to allow anyone to bind the engine sources with its graphic engine without having to modify many lines of code.<br/>
Note: during the development, FisoEngine is only bind with SFML. 

* **What means exactly the term "tile-based"?**
Tile-based means that the world of your game is composed of tiles: a tile is an image that corresponds to a world block, or a floor. Many games are using this kind of world: almost all 2D RPG, turn-based strategy games, etc.

* **Can I use FisoEngine to create big worlds?**
Yes and no. FisoEngine can't be used to handle open-worlds like minecraft, but can be used for prepared world like "levels" world. You can use dynamic map reloading to not loose any performances.

* **Can I freely modify FisoEngine sources?**
Yes. You can do every thing you want with the FisoEngine sources untill you redistribuate them under the same circumstances you got them. For more informations, go to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE page </a>.

* **I have an idea, or I think a part of FisoEngine is not optimised. What should I do?**
Don't hesitate to send me messages to my email adress above. I would like to get feedbacks or more ideas, reviews... I promise sending you an answer below 48 hours maximum.
