### Welcome to my isometric engine repository!

*I am doing a complete redesign of the unstable and awkward first version of <a href="https://github.com/AnselmeClergeot/Fiso-Engine/">Fiso Engine</a>.*

***With this complete redesign:***
* The engine will be simply bindable with any graphic library and not specifically SFML
* The global structure is clarified, rethought, and optimized
* The sources are much simplier to understand because of adding of clear sub-functions
* Many functions refactored
* ...

Also, a regularly updated documentation will be avalaible to learn how to use the engine.

Feel free to contact me at my e-mail adress: anselmedu25@hotmail.com

#### Stay tuned!
